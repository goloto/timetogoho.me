# Time to go home
## Description

😰 Do you prefer to work from home, but have to work in the office?

😢 Can't wait for the sweet moment when you can go home? 

😭 Calculate every second up to this point? 

😡 Mee too!

🥳 So that's the reason why I built this app! 

This app shows timer of how much time is left until the end of the working day. Or (if it's still a working day at this moment) shows how much time is left until the start of the next working day.

❤️ Try it [here](https://timetogoho.me)! ❤️
